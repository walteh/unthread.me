We do not collect or store any personal data. All data is stored in the user's browser. We generate Threads access tokens to keep the private key private. Access tokens are passed through a backend layer to conceal app-specific secrets, but no data relating to the user is saved, stored, or logged.

We do collect IP addresses and session information using Umami analytics (<https://cloud.umami.is/script.js>) to track usage and help with scaling the service as needed. This information is used solely for analytics purposes and is not shared with third parties.

## 3. Data Usage

The information we collect, including IP addresses and session information, is used solely to understand how unthread.me is being used and to help us scale the service appropriately.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not share your data with any other parties except as required by law or with your explicit consent.

## 5. Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including encryption and access controls. This includes protection of access tokens, which are only used to conceal app-specific secrets and are not stored or logged.

## 6. Cookies and Tracking

We use Umami analytics (<https://cloud.umami.is/script.js>) to collect IP addresses and session information for usage tracking. You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings.
